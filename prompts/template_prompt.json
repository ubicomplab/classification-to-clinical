An explanation of the different types of data logged is included below: \nDate: the data in this row was recorded on that date. \ntotal_Distance_traveled(meters): This represents the total distance traveled as measured by the GPS in the participant’s smartphone. This includes walking, driving, and any other modes of transportation. \ntime_at_home(minutes): This is the total time that the participant was at home as determined by their smartphone GPS. \nlocation_entropy: Location entropy measures the variety and frequency of locations (e.g., points-of-interest) visited. It captures the diversity of the locations visited by the user. \nphone_screen_time(minutes): This is the total time the participant’s smartphone was on and unlocked. \nAverage_phone_use_unlock_duration(minutes): This represents the average duration a person used their phone each time they unlocked it. \nphone_call_incoming_duration(minutes): Time spent in received phone calls. \nphone_call_outgoing_duration(minutes): Time spent in phone calls initiated by the person. \nunique_bluetooth_devices_found_nearby: The total number of unique Bluetooth devices detected nearby by the participant’s phone as they go about their day \nstep_count: Total number of steps taken as recorded by their fitness tracker. \nnumber_of_sedentary_episodes: Number of times the user was stationary as measured by their fitness tracker. \ntotal_time_spent_sedentary(minutes), Amount of time the user spent stationary as measured by their fitness tracker. \nnumber_of_activity_episodes: Number of times the user was moving around as measured by their fitness tracker. \ntotal_time_spent_active(minutes): Amount of time the user spent moving around as measured by their fitness tracker. \ntotal_time_asleep(minutes): Total time the user spent asleep as measured by their fitness tracker. \ntotal_time_spent_awake_while_in_bed(minutes): Total time the user spent in bed but awake as measured by their fitness tracker.",
