An explanation of the different types of data logged is included below: \nDate: the data in this row was recorded on that date. \ntotal_Distance_traveled(meters): This represents the total distance traveled as measured by the GPS in the participant\u2019s smartphone. This includes walking, driving, and any other modes of transportation. \ntime_at_home(minutes): This is the total time that the participant was at home as determined by their smartphone GPS. \nlocation_entropy: Location entropy measures the variety and frequency of locations (e.g., points-of-interest) visited. It captures the diversity of the locations visited by the user. \nphone_screen_time(minutes): This is the total time the participant\u2019s smartphone was on and unlocked. \nAverage_phone_use_unlock_duration(minutes): This represents the average duration a person used their phone each time they unlocked it. \nphone_call_incoming_duration(minutes): Time spent in received phone calls. \nphone_call_outgoing_duration(minutes): Time spent in phone calls initiated by the person. \nunique_bluetooth_devices_found_nearby: The total number of unique Bluetooth devices detected nearby by the participant\u2019s phone as they go about their day \nstep_count: Total number of steps taken as recorded by their fitness tracker. \nnumber_of_sedentary_episodes: Number of times the user was stationary as measured by their fitness tracker. \ntotal_time_spent_sedentary(minutes), Amount of time the user spent stationary as measured by their fitness tracker. \nnumber_of_activity_episodes: Number of times the user was moving around as measured by their fitness tracker. \ntotal_time_spent_active(minutes): Amount of time the user spent moving around as measured by their fitness tracker. \ntotal_time_asleep(minutes): Total time the user spent asleep as measured by their fitness tracker. \ntotal_time_spent_awake_while_in_bed(minutes): Total time the user spent in bed but awake as measured by their fitness tracker. \nInstructions \n 1. Based on the collected data, hypothesize about the overall mental health of the individual with detail explainations. \n 2. Make your best guess if this person is currently experiencing depression. Please answer only \"Yes\" or \"No\" in this question without any other notes",
